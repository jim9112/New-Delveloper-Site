            <h2>Documentation of the Development Process</h2>
            <p>This page was created for my fictional uncle Kyle. The goal was to create a simple web page that that
            promoted Kyles business and reflects my fictional uncles love of the state of New Hampshire. The site needs
            to explain what uncle Kyle’s business does, why the customer should do business with him, and a way to
            contact him if interested in learning more. This site was an attempt to encapsulate all of those needs.</p>
            <h2>Defense of the Final Product</h2>
            <p>The main home page has basic information about the kind of business that Kyle runs, along with an embeded
            video that highlights why small businesses can benefit from the kind of service that Kyle provides. The
            website includes a contact page which allows the user to fill out a form requesting to be contacted by Kyle
            for further information. The next page that is included gives testimonials from other customers to help
            persuade potential customers to utilize Kyles services. There is also a page that provides links to
            resources for business owners on other sites. The design of the site is cohesive, the background, colors
            and fonts are the same across each page. Each page also has the menus, main header, and main content
            located in the same spots. This allows the user to easily transition from page to page and quickly find
            what they are looking for.</p>
            <h2>Opportunities for Improvement and Growth</h2>
            <p>In the future incorporating social media into the site may help with growth. Also, because each page does
            not contain a lot of content switching to a single page design may be more effective and more in keeping
            with current design treneds.</p>
